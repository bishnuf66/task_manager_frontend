## Frontend Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed before setting up the frontend:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps to Run the Frontend Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Clone the repository using Git:

   git clone https://github.com/bishnuf66/task_manager_frontend.git
   cd task_manager_frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   After cloning the repository, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the frontend directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
   ```

   Replace `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` with the actual API URL of your backend.

4. **Start the development server:**

   Run the development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
